## Game Mechanics

### Detailed Explanation of Game Mechanics
The game is turn-based, meaning each hero and enemy takes turns to move and attack. Heroes have different stats that determine their abilities, such as attack power, range, agility, and health points (HP).

### Combat System
Combat involves moving your heroes on a grid and attacking enemies within range. Each hero has a limited number of moves per turn, determined by their agility. Use the arrow keys to move and the spacebar to attack.

### Special Abilities and Effects
Heroes have special abilities that can affect combat in various ways. For example, some heroes can heal others, inflict burn damage, or knock back enemies. These abilities are determined by the hero's stats and can be used strategically to gain an advantage.

### Agility-Based Turn Order
In the game, the turn order of heroes is determined by their agility stat. Heroes with higher agility take their turns before those with lower agility. If two heroes have the same agility, the turn order can be randomized or based on their initial placement.
