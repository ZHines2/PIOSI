## Summit Mode

### Overview

Summit Mode is a new game mode where all heroes compete at the same time on a large 50x50 map. The player controls one hero of their choice, while the others are controlled by the computer.

### Rules

- Each hero takes a turn moving on the map, with the turn order determined by their agility stat.
- Heroes with higher agility take their turns before those with lower agility.
- If two heroes have the same agility, the turn order can be randomized or based on their initial placement.
- When the player is defeated by any hero, it is game over.
- If a computer-controlled hero is defeated, they join the player's team and their turn is controlled by the player.

By following these guidelines and best practices, you can create heroes that are balanced, engaging, and fun for players. Happy hero designing!
